## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use this profile to host random programs that come to mind - mostly Sudoku-related, but sometimes clocks and other strange ideas.

I'm also a strong advocate for freedom and creative expression.  
Because of that, I choose not to use my face as a profile picture.

ðŸ‘‰ [Hereâ€™s why.](https://github.com/Ricky295/why-i-dont-have-my-face-as-pfp/blob/main/README.md)

I'm open to profile picture suggestions - just not my face. Expecially since my profile picture is very old.
